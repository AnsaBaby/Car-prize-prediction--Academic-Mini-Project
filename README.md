# Car prize prediction - Academic Mini Project
My academic Mini Project to predict the car prize prediction for both used and new cars. 



Introduction

The objective of this study is to analyse associations and features that can predict the costs of both pre-owned and brand-new vehicles with precision. We willemploy a broad array of data science methodologies to gather and scrutinize data on various factors that may influence car prices, such as brand, model, year ofregistration, mileage, and amenities.
Through this project, we strive to uncover the underlying associations and variations in the data that may affect car prices, and conduct both association and groupdifferences analysis.
In this task,i critically analyze a real-world problem and use data to gain insights through the use of predictive models. I will be building models using a variety oftechniques, and evaluating their performance. Through this process, I will learn to critically assess the strengths and limitations of different models and gain a deeperunderstanding of the problem at hand.


Aims & Objectives

The focus of this project is driven by two primary, broad data science inquiries:

1.Which factors are most influential in determining the cost of a car? In other words, by examining individual characteristics and the interactions of pairs ofattributes within the dataset, which elements seem to have the strongest correlation with the price feature, and what underlying explanations andunderstandings can we deduce from these discoveries?

2.Are there compelling clusters in the data that exhibit noteworthy distinctions (e.g., patterns, averages) in price when considering one or two characteristics?What can we glean from these observations and how valuable could these insights be for the industry?


The objectives of this project can be written as follows:

1.To identify the most important predictors of car prices by analyzing individual features and interactions of pairs of features in the dataset.

2.To explore interesting groupings of the data that exhibit significant differences in price, involving one or two features.

3.To understand the underlying explanations and insights behind the findings of the best predictors of car prices.

4.To determine the usefulness of the findings for the automotive industry by evaluating the practical implications of the insights gained from the interestinggroupings of the data.
